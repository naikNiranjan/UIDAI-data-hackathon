# Aadhaar Readiness Index - Project Brief

## The Core Problem

**Aadhaar enrolment is high, but Aadhaar usability is uneven.**

Millions of citizens face authentication failures at critical moments:
- Ration shops deny food due to biometric failures
- Scholarships rejected due to name mismatches
- Banking services blocked due to outdated records

## What We're Measuring

**Aadhaar Readiness** = The ability of Aadhaar to successfully authenticate citizens during critical services.

High enrolment ≠ High usability

## Three Failure Buckets

| Bucket | What Fails |
|--------|------------|
| **Biometric Usability** | Ration shops, Face KYC, Banking eKYC |
| **OTP Contactability** | Youth turning 18, SIM/UPI services |And many pepole with commaon phone number
| **Identity Consistency** | DBT payments, Scholarships | Old biometric data



## The Insight

> "These failures are NOT due to lack of Aadhaar adoption. They are due to lack of proactive update readiness."



## Data Available

- **Biometric Updates** - by state, district, pincode, age group
- **Demographic Updates** - by state, district, pincode, age group  
- **Enrolment Data** - by state, district, pincode, age group
